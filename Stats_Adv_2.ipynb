Distribution of Sample Means: According to the Central Limit Theorem, regardless of the original uniform distribution of test scores, the distribution of these 1,000 sample means will approximate a normal distribution. As you continue to increase the sample size beyond 30, the approximation will improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Mean and Standard Error: The mean of the distribution of sample means will be close to the population mean of 50, and the standard error will be calculated as \\( \\sigma/\\sqrt{n} \\), which in this case would be approximately \\(29/\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.3\\).\n",

    " Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem is powerful because it allows statisticians to make inferences about population parameters using sample statistics, even when the population distribution is not normal, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.'''"
